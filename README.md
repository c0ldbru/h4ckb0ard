The rot13labs h4ckb0ard is an open source 40% keyboard made by hackers for hackers.

This hardware has been made open source to encourage others to learn about keyboards and how they're made. A limited run of h4ckb0ards will be sold from the rot13labs shop but if you would like to make your own, everything you need can be found in this repo. Feel free to use, modify, or redistribute these files as you see fit, but please ensure credit for the creation of this keyboard by c0ldbru / rot13labs is retaied.
